# Deep-Learning
### Select deep learning and computer vision code.

#### `misc/LearnXOR`
At some point, every machine learner should implement a network that learns XOR. The folder `LearnXOR` is my implementation from the early days.

#### `misc/Demo`
To see a live one-shot learning demo with a simple laptop and webcam, take a look at `Demo`.

#### `misc/Decision-Trees`
The table data structure in the Lua language is quite versatile. In `Decision-Trees`, I use Lua tables alone to construct decision trees and random forests from arbitrary numerical and categorial datasets, such as MNIST or iris.txt.
