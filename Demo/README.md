### The Demo
Running qlua demo.lua will automatically download the necessary front network and will use default loss function and learning rate to start a demo. 

It may be helpful to know that Head.lua is an adaptable module and represents the additional architecture on top of a convolutional neural network. Modify this file to create more diverse additional architectures.
